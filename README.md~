KNOTS
=====

At this point of time, this is what the program can do (as of now):

1.) Take an input knot: The input methods are quite intutive.
Mouse motion is for x and y axes, scroll is for z axis.

2.) Find the crossings and mark them: Red is for positive weighted crossing,
Black is for negitive. Writhe is calculated as the total of them all.

3.) Find the DT code: The DT code is calculated according to the orientation
Assigned while drawing the knot. The first crossing is taken as 1.

4.) Rotate the knot: Use 'z' to toggle rotation mode.

5.) Find the fox-n colorability of the knot. At this moment it cannot be done
in the program and the value of n needs to be changed through the code. 
Setting it to 3 gives tricolorability
